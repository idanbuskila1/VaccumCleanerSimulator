## Brief Description
The design ensures a clear separation of responsibilities and efficient operation of each
component. The `VacuumCleaner` class tracks the robot's state, the `HouseManager` class
manages the mapping and cleaning status of the house, and the `MyAlgorithm` class
implements the logic for the robot's actions using an enum `AlgoState` to manage different
states. This modular design allows for easy maintenance and scalability while ensuring that the
robot can effectively navigate and clean the house.
